# Security Documentation

## 🔒 Security Enhancements Applied

This document outlines the comprehensive security fixes and enhancements implemented to protect the Interactive Assignments application from various security vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Organization Public Access Policy (HIGH RISK)
**Issue**: Organization table had overly permissive public read policy allowing unrestricted access.

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced `USING (true)` with role-based access control
- Anonymous users can only see basic organization info for login
- Authenticated users can only see organizations they belong to
- Organization creators can see their own organizations

### 2. Hardcoded Supabase Project ID (HIGH RISK)
**Issue**: Supabase project ID was exposed in email trigger function.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed hardcoded URLs from SQL functions
- Implemented environment variable-based URL construction
- Added fallback URL generation from database settings

### 3. Assignment RLS NULL Bypass (HIGH RISK)
**Issue**: NULL organization_id allowed unauthorized access to assignments.

**Fix Applied**:
- Restricted NULL organization_id to published assignments only
- Added proper role-based access controls
- Implemented admin-only deletion for organization assignments

### 4. File Upload Security (HIGH RISK)
**Issue**: Insufficient file validation allowing malicious uploads.

**Fix Applied**:
- Comprehensive file type validation using MIME types and signatures
- File size limits enforced (10MB audio, 5MB images, 2MB documents)
- Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks
- Magic number validation to prevent file type spoofing

### 5. XSS Vulnerability in Certificate Generation (HIGH RISK)
**Issue**: Unescaped HTML content in certificate templates.

**Fix Applied**:
- Input sanitization using DOMPurify
- URL validation before rendering
- HTML entity escaping for all user-generated content

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **DOMPurify Integration**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Content Length Limits**: Title (200 chars), Description (2000 chars), Organization name (100 chars)
- **Email Format Validation**: RFC-compliant email validation
- **Password Strength Validation**: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
img-src 'self' data: https: blob:;
font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://*.supabase.in wss://*.supabase.co wss://*.supabase.in;
media-src 'self' blob: data:;
object-src 'none';
base-uri 'self';
form-action 'self';
```

### Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()`

### Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enforced on all tables
- **Input Validation Functions**: Server-side validation for emails and organization names
- **Audit Logging**: Security events tracked in `security_audit_log` table
- **Content Constraints**: Database-level validation for data integrity

### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: MIME type and magic number verification
- **Size Limits**: Enforced per file type
- **Filename Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters
- **Signature Validation**: Prevents file type spoofing

### Rate Limiting
- **Login Attempts**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **API Requests**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Infrastructure**: Rate limiting table and functions implemented

## 📋 Security Audit Log

The application now logs the following security events:
- Login success/failure
- Password changes
- Assignment CRUD operations
- Organization CRUD operations
- File uploads
- Permission denied events
- Rate limit exceeded events

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
All environment variables are validated on application startup:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Must be valid HTTPS Supabase URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Must be valid JWT format

### Security Settings
Security configuration is centralized in `src/lib/config/securityConfig.ts`:
- Rate limiting parameters
- File upload limits
- Content validation rules
- CSP directives
- Trusted domains

## 🚀 Running Security Fixes

To apply all security fixes to your database:

```bash
# Run the security migration script
node scripts/run-security-fixes.mjs
```

This script will:
1. Apply all RLS policy fixes
2. Add input validation functions
3. Create audit logging tables
4. Add content validation constraints
5. Verify all fixes were applied correctly

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test organization access with different user roles
- [ ] Verify file upload restrictions work
- [ ] Test input sanitization in forms
- [ ] Verify rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Test assignment access controls
- [ ] Verify audit logging is working

### Automated Security Checks
The application performs runtime security checks on startup:
- Environment variable validation
- CSP header verification
- Exposed sensitive data detection
- Development/production configuration validation

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Audit Log Queries
```sql
-- View recent security events
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 100;

-- Check for failed login attempts
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as failed_attempts
FROM security_audit_log 
WHERE action = 'LOGIN_FAILURE' 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Monitor file uploads
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log 
WHERE action = 'FILE_UPLOAD' 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### Rate Limiting Monitoring
```sql
-- Check rate limiting activity
SELECT identifier, action, attempts, window_start
FROM rate_limit_log 
WHERE window_start > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY attempts DESC;
```
